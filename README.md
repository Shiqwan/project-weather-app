# Weather App

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
building a weather app in teams, using API and general JS, html and CSS.

## The problem

One of the main things this week ahs been working in a team of two, I had the luck of getting partnered up with the indispensible Hand Nguyen-Vu, and the work itself wasn't necessarily the issue but rather finding the time between to busy people's schedules to get things in place. 
I feel unfortunately this took away from the learning process of today's subject, even though I learned a lot from working with Hang in general. We kept our communication-lines opened and tried to divide things when we could and work in branches as effectively as possible, which I feel we succeded with.
If I had more time, I would have figured out the if else for the background-image, which doesn't feel like a complicated thing to do, but the current timeframe hasn't allowed for me to figure it out just yet, hopefully it'll be something one can come back to!
